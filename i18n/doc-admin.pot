"At a meeting, a colleague tells Max about trouble ticket systems and how "
"they can solve Max's problems with customer support. After looking for "
"information on the Internet, Max decides to install OTRS on a computer that "
"is accessible from the web by both his customers and his employees. Now, the "
"customer requests are no longer sent to Max's private inbox but to the mail "
"account that is used for OTRS. The ticket system is connected to this "
"mailbox and saves all requests in its database. For every new request, the "
"system automatically generates an answer and sends it to the customer so "
"that the customer knows that his request has arrived and will be answered "
"soon. OTRS generates an explicit reference, the ticket number, for every "
"single request. Customers are now happy because their requests are "
"acknowledged and it is not necessary to send a second message with the same "
"question. Max, John, and Joe can now log into OTRS with a simple web browser "
"and answer the requests. Since the system locks a ticket that is answered, "
"no message is edited twice."

"Of course, this is only a short preview of the possibilities and features of "
"trouble ticket systems. But if your company has to attend to a high volume "
"of customer requests through emails and phone calls, and if different "
"service representatives need to respond at different times, a ticket system "
"can be of great assistance. It can help streamline work flow processes, add "
"efficiencies, and improve your overall productivity. A ticket system helps "
"you to flexibly structure your Support or Help Desk "
"environment. Communications between customers and service staff become more "
"transparent. The net result is an increase in service effectiveness. And no "

"A trouble ticket is similar to a medical report created for a hospital "
"patient. When a patient first visits the hospital, a medical report is "
"created to hold all necessary personal and medical information on him. Over "
"multiple visits, as he is attended to by the same or additional doctors, the "
"attending doctor updates the report by adding new information on the "
"patient's health and the ongoing treatment. This allows any other doctors or "
"the nursing staff to get a complete picture on the case at hand. When the "
"patient recovers and leaves the hospital, all information from the medical "
"report is archived and the report is closed."

"Trouble ticket systems such as OTRS handle trouble tickets like normal "
"email. The messages are saved in the system. When a customer sends a "
"request, a new ticket is generated by the system which is comparable to a "
"new medical report being created. The response to this new ticket is "
"comparable to a doctor's entry in the medical report. A ticket is closed if "
"an answer is sent back to the customer, or if the ticket is separately "
"closed by the system. If a customer responds again on an already closed "
"ticket, the ticket is reopened with the new information added. Every ticket "
"is stored and archived with complete information. Since tickets are handled "
"like normal emails, attachments and contextual annotations will also be "
"stored with each email. In addition, information on relevant dates, "
"employees involved, working time needed for ticket resolution, etc. are also "
"saved. At any later stage, tickets can be sorted, and it is possible to "
"search through and analyze all information using different filtering "
"mechanisms."
