<title>Filtering Incoming Email Messages</title>

<para>
OTRS has the capability to filter incoming email messages. For example, it is possible to put certain emails automatically into specified queues, or to set a specific state or ticket type for some mails. The filters apply to all incoming mails. You can manage your filters via the link "PostMaster Filter" on the Admin page (see figure below).

<para>
A filter consists of one or more criteria that must be met in order for the defined actions to be executed on the email. Filter criteria may be defined for the headers or the body of an email, e.g. search for specific header entries, such as a sender address, or on strings in the body. Even regular expressions can be used for extended pattern matching. If your filter matches, you can set fields using the X-OTRS headers in the GUI. These values will be applied when creating the ticket or follow-up message in OTRS. The Table 4-5 lists the different X-OTRS headers and their meaning.

<para>
You also can use X-OTRS-FollowUp-* headers to set values for follow up emails.

            Use the form "+ $Number $Unit", where $Unit can be 's' (seconds), 'm' (minutes), 'h' (hours) or 'd' (days).
            Only one unit can be specified. Examples of valid settings: "+50s" (pending in 50 seconds), "+30m" (30 minutes),
            "+12d" (12 days). Note that settings like "+1d 12h" are not possible. You can specify "+36h" instead.

<para>
You should specify a name for every filter rule. Filter criteria can be specified in the section "Filter Condition". Choose via the listboxes for "Header 1", "Header 2" and so on for the parts of the messages where you would like to search, and specify on the right side the values you wish to filter on. In the section "Set Email Headers", you can choose the actions that are triggered if the filter rules match. You can select for "Header 1", "Header 2" and so on to select the X-OTRS-Header and set the associated values (see figure below).
</para>

<para>
Filter rules are evaluated in alphabetical order, and are all executed except if the "Stop after match" setting has been set to "Yes" in one of the rules (in this case evaluation of the remaining filters is canceled).

<title>Sort spam mails into a specific queue</title>

<para>
A useful filter rule would be to let OTRS automatically move mails marked for spam, by using a spam detection tool such as SpamAssassin, into the "Junk" queue. SpamAssassin adds the "X-Spam-Flag" header to every checked mail. When the mail is marked as spam, the Header is set to "Yes". So the filter criteria would be "X-Spam-Flag: Yes". To create a filter rule with this criteria you can insert the name as, for example, "spam-mails". In the section for "Filter Condition", choose "X-Spam-Flag:" for "Header 1" from the listbox. Insert "Yes" as value for this header. Now the filter criteria is specified. To make sure that all spam mails are placed into the "Junk" queue, choose in the section for "Set Email Headers", the "X-OTRS-Queue:" entry for "Header 1". Specify "Junk" as value for this header. Finally add the new filter rule to activate it for new messages in the system.

There are additional modules, that can be used to <link linkend="email-receiving-filter">filter incoming messages</link> more specifically. These modules might be useful when dealing with larger, more complex systems.
