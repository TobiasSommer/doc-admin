    <title>The OTRS Daemon</title>
    <para>
        The OTRS Daemon is an independent set of system processes that plan and
execute tasks in background, either on a recurrent basis or triggered by
events. OTRS Daemon is fundamental for the correct system operation.
    </para>
    <para>
        In previous versions of OTRS (from 3.1 to 4) there was another process
called OTRS Scheduler that does part of the work that the OTRS Demon do in
OTRS 5. This old process is replaced by the OTRS Daemon which was re-written
from the ground to make it more stable, scalable and robust than its
predecessor.
    </para>
    <para>
        The OTRS Daemon is capable to handle up to 10 tasks at the same time and it
can work cooperatively with other OTRS Daemons on different frontend servers
in a cluster environment.
    </para>
    <para>
        When idle OTRS Daemon consist in five processes:

                <para>
                    This daemon executes all tasks that have in a list, in a first in first out
basis. It can handle simultaneous tasks by creating its own children
processes and it checks the task list several times per second. The task
list can be filled by task manager daemons, event handlers, and other parts
of the system.
                </para>
                <para>
                    Its main mission is to handle all the tasks in the list as soon as possible.

                <para>
                    This daemon checks for non recurring tasks that are set to be executed in
the future (e.g. when a Generic Interface invoker tries to reach a server
and it can't, a task could be set to schedule for execution in the next 5
minutes).  At the correct time it sends it the task worker daemon.

                <para>
                    This daemon calculates when is the next execution time of all recurring
tasks (e.g. a cache cleanup one time per week ). This kind of tasks are
specified in the SysConfig. At the right time for each task it sends the
required information to the task worker daemon to execute them.

                <para>
                    This daemon scans for Generic Agent jobs stored in the database that have a
time schedule (discarding all other Generic Agent jobs that are set to
executed by events). When is time to run a Generic Agent job it sends the
task information to the task worker daemon to handle the task.

    <note>
        <para>
            The number of active processes depends on the number of tasks that the OTRS
Daemon is executing simultaneously in a time frame.
        </para>
    </note>
    <para>
        By default the each daemon logs all error messages on a separated file
located in <filename>/opt/otrs/var/log/Daemon/*.log</filename>. These logs
are kept in the system for a defined period. To change this behavior and/or
to also log the non error messages, please update SysConfig settings in
<literal>Daemon</literal> -&gt; <literal>Core::Log</literal>.
    </para>
    <para>
        When a task could not be executed successfully for any reason, an email is
sent to a predefined recipient reporting the issue. The content of the email
includes the error messages and trace (if available).
    </para>
    <para>
        The OTRS Daemon is an automated process that normally does not require human
interaction.  However it is possible to query its status and start or stop
it if needed.
    </para>
    <para>
        To be sure that the OTRS Daemon is running there is a Cron job that
constantly checks that the process is alive. The main daemon is prepared to
work even without a database connection, so is perfectly safe if the Cron
task to start it is executed even before the database process in the system
startup, and it is also tolerant to database disconnections.
    </para>
    <para>
        If for any reason the OTRS Daemon needs to be stop (for example during a
system maintenance), all unhandled tasks are saved, and as soon as the
process is started again it continues with all pending tasks. For recurring
tasks it will only execute the last instance of the task (if its due time
was during the downtime).
