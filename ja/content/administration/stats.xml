<title>統計</title>

<para>
The OTRS statistics module holds features to track operational statistics
and generates custom reports associated with OTRS usage. The OTRS system
uses the term "statistic" generically to refer to a single report presenting
various indicators.
</para>
<note>
    <para>
        For <ulink url="https://www.otrs.com/solutions/"><emphasis role="bold">OTRS
Business Solution™</emphasis></ulink> customers, there is also a reports
generator available. Here "report" refers to a collection of several
statistics in one PDF document that can be easily configured and
automatically generated and distributed. Please find more details in the

</note>

<para>
Proper configuration of the OTRS statistics module is associated with a
multitude of requirements and considerations. These include the various OTRS
modules to be evaluated, user permission settings, indicators to be
calculated and their complexity levels, ease of configuration of the
statistics module, speed and efficiency of calculations, and support of a
rich set of output variants.
</para>

<para>
Statistical elements, i.e. files which supplement the functionality of the
statistics module for specific requirements, can be integrated for
calculating complex statistics.

<title>Statistics Configuration and Usage</title>

<para>
When signed on as an agent, the statistics module can be opened by selecting
"Reports" and then "Statistics" in the main menu.
</para>

<section id="stats-overview" >
    <title>概要</title>

    <para>
    Selecting the "Statistics" link in the navigation bar, and then the submenu
link "Overview", calls up the Overview screen. The Overview screen presents
a list of all pre-configured reports the agent can use (see figure below).

it comes preloaded with a few sample statistics imported into the
system. These are shown as a list on the overview page. If the overview list
extends to more than a single page, the agent can browse through the
different pages. The list of statistics can be sorted as desired, by
clicking the desired column header in the list. To generate a particular
statistic, click on the statistic's "Run now" link.

<section id="stats-modify-new">
    <title>構成</title>

    <para>
    Agents with write rights can edit an existing report configuration by
calling up the edit user interface of the statistics module. Alternately,
they may create a new report.
    </para>

    <para>
    There are four possible steps in the configuration of a statistic: the
general specification data, configuring the x-axis, y-axis and possible data
filters for the reported data (or restrictions).  Let's create a new
statistic as an example by clicking the "Add" button in the overview
screen.  Our goal will be to get an overview of how many tickets with very
high priority are in every queue (x-axis) and state (y-axis).  <figure>
        <title>Adding a new statistic, first step.</title>
<screenshot>
<graphic
fileref="screenshots/administration/stats/stats-add-typeselection.png"
scalefit="1" width="100%" contentdepth="100%"/></screenshot></figure>

    </para>

    <para>
        At the beginning we have to select the type of statistic we want to
add. Three types are available: <variablelist>
            <varlistentry>
                <term>Dynamic Matrix Statistics</term>
                <listitem>
                    <para>
                        This type of statistics will generate a matrix of computed values (e.g. new
tickets per day of month and queue).  All value cells in the matrix have the
same type (number, average time, etc.).  Values are computed from entities
in the system (e.g. tickets).  Some matrix statistics support a summation
column and/or row (only useful for certain data).
                    </para>
                </listitem>
            </varlistentry>
            <varlistentry>
                <term>Dynamic List Statistics</term>
                <listitem>
                    <para>
                        This kind of statistic will generate a table where every line (not cell)
represents an entity in the system (e. g. a ticket).  The columns in this
row are usually configurable (x-axis, see below) and contain the data of
this object (e. g. ticket attributes).  All value cells in one column have
the same type.
                    </para>
                </listitem>
            </varlistentry>
            <varlistentry>
                <term>Static Statistics</term>
                <listitem>
                    <para>
                        This kind of statistic is not very much configurable and usually used for
very special and/or complex computations.
                    </para>
                </listitem>
            </varlistentry>
        </variablelist> So
let's select "Dynamic Matrix" for our example. Then the "General
Specifications" configuration will appear below the statistic type
selection.
    </para>
    <para>
        <figure>
            <title>Adding a new statistic, second step.</title>
<screenshot>
<graphic fileref="screenshots/administration/stats/stats-add-general.png"
scalefit="1" width="100%" contentdepth="100%"/></screenshot></figure> After providing a title and description
for the new statistic, we have to select the statistics backend that we want
to use.  This is the actual backend module which is responsible to collect
and analyze the data for our statistic.  In our case we'll select
"TicketAccumulation".
    </para>
    <para>
        By configuring permission groups, we can facilitate a restriction of the
groups (and therefore, agents) who can later view and generate the
pre-configured statistics. Thus the various statistics can be allocated to
the different departments and work groups who need them. It is possible to
allocate one statistic to various groups.  <example>
            <title>Default statistics permission group</title>
            <para>
                The "stats" group was selected. The report is viewable for all users having
at least ro rights for the "stats" group. This access is available by
default.
            </para>
        </example> <example>
            <title>Customized statistics permission group</title>
            <para>
                A group named "sales" was selected. All users with ro rights for the "sales"
group can see the stat in the view mode and generate it. However, the report
will not be available for viewing by other users.
            </para>
        </example> Additionally, possible output
formats can be selected. Here we can just keep all output formats and choose
the one to use when actually generating the statistic. Let's save the
statistic now.
    </para>
    <para>
        The next screen will indicate the next step with a highlighted button: we
should configure the x-axis. By clicking the button, a dialog will appear
where we can select the element to be used for the x-axis. In our case that
will be the queue: <figure>
            <title>Configuring the x-axis of a statistic.</title>
<screenshot>
<graphic fileref="screenshots/administration/stats/stats-config-xaxis.png"
scalefit="1" width="100%" contentdepth="100%"/></screenshot></figure> We can optionally
limit the queues to be shown by selecting some in the queue field. With the
checkbox we can control if the agent who generates the statistic can make
changes to the queue selection.  We'll keep the defaults and press "Save".
    </para>
    <para>
        Now we can configure the y-axis in the same way: select the state field.
<figure>
            <title>Configuring the y-axis of a statistic.</title>
<screenshot>
<graphic fileref="screenshots/administration/stats/stats-config-yaxis.png"
scalefit="1" width="100%" contentdepth="100%"/></screenshot></figure> Here it is possible to select one
element or two. In the first case, every value of the element will be one
element on the y-axis. If two elements are selected, their permutations will
be the elements on the value series.  For example you could select "state"
and "priority", and the resulting elements will be "new - 1 very low", "new
- 2 low", ... "open - 1 very low" and so on. Let's just use the state and
press "Save".
    </para>
    <para>
        Now in the last step we could add data filters to only report tickets
belonging to a certain customer, with certain priorities and so on. We'll
add a filter for very high priority tickets: <figure>
            <title>Configuring the data filter of a statistic.</title>
<screenshot>
<graphic fileref="screenshots/administration/stats/stats-config-filter.png"
scalefit="1" width="100%" contentdepth="100%"/></screenshot></figure> Now press "Save" again. The configuration is finished.
    </para>
    <para>
        You may already have noted that in the configuration dialog there is a
preview area where we can check the effect of our configuration settings.

    </para>

    <note>
        <para>
            Please note that the preview uses random data and does not consider data
restrictions.
        </para>
    </note>

    <para>
        The statistic is configured. By pressing the "Run now" button we can go to
the View screen where the desired output format can be selected and the
statistic can be generated in the different formats.
    </para>

    <para>
        The Import user interface can be accessed by pressing the "Import" button on
the Overview screen. "rw" permissions for the statistics module are

            It usually does not make sense to generate reports manually via the command
line, as the statistics module has a convenient graphical user
interface. However, generating reports manually does make sense when
combined with a cron job.  Imagine the following scenario: On the first day
of every month, the heads of department want to receive a report for the
past month. By combining a cron job and command line call the reports can be
sent to them automatically by e-mail.
