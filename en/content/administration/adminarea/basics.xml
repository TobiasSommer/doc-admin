        The following system configuration settings are available to OTRS administrators by
        accessing the Admin page of the OTRS web interface - adding agents, customers and
        queues, ticket and mail settings, installing additional packages such as FAQ and ITSM,
        and much more.

    <para>
        Agents who are members of the <emphasis>admin</emphasis> group can access the Admin
        area by clicking the <emphasis>Admin</emphasis> link in the navigation bar (see figure
        below). Agents without sufficiently elevated access rights will not be able to access
        this link.
