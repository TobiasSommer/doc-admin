        System Maintenance give the option to schedule one or more maintenance
periods for the system. During this period no agents or customers can login
into the system (except for Agents in the "admin" group). Current logged
users and customers receive a notification about the maintenance (before and
during the maintenance period). Administrators have the option to kill the
sessions for logged agents and customers, all this in preparation to be able
to make changes in the system (e.g. a system update) in a "safe"
environment.
