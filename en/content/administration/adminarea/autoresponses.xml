<title>Auto Responses</title>

<para>
OTRS allows you to send automatic responses to customers based on the occurrence of certain events, such as the creation of a ticket in a specific queue, the receipt of a follow-up message in regards to a ticket, the closure or rejection of a ticket, etc. To manage such responses, click the link "Auto responses" on the Admin page (see figure below).

<para>
The subject and text of auto responses can be generated by variables, just as in signatures and salutations. If you insert, for example, the variable &lt;OTRS_CUSTOMER_EMAIL[5]&gt; into the body of the auto answer, the first 5 lines of the customer mail text will be inserted into the auto answer. You will find more details about the valid variables that can be used at the bottom of the screen shown in the Figure.
</para>

<para>
For every automatic answer, you can specify the event that should trigger it. The system events that are available after a default installation are described in the Table 4-4.

<para>
As with other OTRS entities, auto responses too cannot be deleted, only deactivated, by setting the Valid option to <emphasis>invalid</emphasis> or <emphasis>invalid-temporarily</emphasis>.
</para>
</note>

<para>
To add an auto response to a queue, use the "Auto Response &lt;-&gt; Queues" link on the Admin page (see figure below). All system events are listed for every queue, and an auto answer with the same event can be selected or removed via a listbox.
